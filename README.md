# Lync Server 2010 icons for PlantUML

It uses the topology icons available at [Lync Server 2010 Visio Stencil](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20891) (LyncServer2010VisioStencil.vss) which provides some Microsoft icons of Windows Server 2008' era.

PlantUML doesn't handle PNG alpha (transparent images), so I moved the original PNG files to the ``alpha/`` subfolder for anyone interested on them.

Also the PNG rendering was huge, so I resize their width/height by 96px (width).

The VSS stencil to SVG/PNG conversion process has been documented [here](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=pt&tl=en&hl=pt-BR&u=https://eduardomozartdeoliveira.wordpress.com/2023/01/30/instalacao-do-libvisio2svg-no-macos/).
